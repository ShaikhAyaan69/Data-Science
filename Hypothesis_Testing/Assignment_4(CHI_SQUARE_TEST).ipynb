This means that the statistical evidence does not support a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and customer satisfaction levels. In other words, customer satisfaction appears to be independent of the type of smart home device they buy. Therefore, variations in satisfaction levels are likely due to other factors not related to the type of device purchased, and the observed differences in satisfaction across device types can be attributed to random chance."
